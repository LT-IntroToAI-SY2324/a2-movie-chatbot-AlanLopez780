# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
It was difficult in the beginning where I had no idea how to set up the conditions. But now that I get the gist of it, I was able to actually get some work done.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
A user would type in a query, and the match function would try to find a set of strings that match the user's input. If the input matches on of the set of strings, then the match function would run based on the conditions met within the function. Else, if there is no matching set of strings for the input, the function would just return none.
